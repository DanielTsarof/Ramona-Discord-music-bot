# Ramona music bot

The basis of the project is taken from here https://gist.github.com/vbe0201/ade9b80f2d3b64643d854938d40a0a2d

I made some improvements and added new features. user_bl and song_bl commands have been added (see functions
documentation for more information). Bot uses ffmpeg to extract audio from YouTube video.
ffmpeg directory is not necessary for bot to work.
The project continues to improve.
